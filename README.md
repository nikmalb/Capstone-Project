# Capstone-Project
Hi there!

I am a student of the University of Lucerne and I am currently taking a course in Data Mininig. This repository is used for my final capstone project of the course. The project is about the Weather API. I am interested in the weather data of some European Capital Cities, where I want to see patterns in the locations and forecast the temperature for the next 5 days.

This repository is structured als follows: The Scripts folder contains the scripts I used to mine and analyze the data. The Plot folder contains the plots I created with the data. The Output folder contains a markdown file with a short report of the project.

I hope you enjoy my project! If you have any questions or suggestions, feel free to contact me.

Best regards, Nikolina
